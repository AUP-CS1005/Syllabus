### Attendance Policy
Attendance is mandatory in all classes and attendance affects the grade. In case of three unexcused absents, a grade of "F" is automatically given.


IN ALL CASES OF MISSED COURSE MEETINGS, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR
COMMUNICATION WITH THE PROFESSOR, AND FOR ARRANGING TO MAKE UP MISSED
WORK, RESTS SOLELY WITH THE STUDENT.

Whether an absence is excused or not is ALWAYS up to the discretion of
the professor or the department. Unexcused absences can result in a low
or failing participation grade. In the case of excessive absences, it is
up to the professor or the department to decide if the student will
receive an "F" for the course. An instructor may recommend that a
student withdraw, if absences have made it impossible to continue in the
course at a satisfactory level.
Students must be mindful of this policy when making their travel
arrangements, and especially during the Drop/Add and Exam Periods.

### Grading Policy
* 10% midterm
* 40% exercises
* 50% project

### Learning Outcome
Students are expected to learn how to develop software and content using a computer by using the HTML/CSS markup languages. In addition, they will learn the use of frameworks in order to improve the result. Some very basic programming in JavaScript will also be covered.
